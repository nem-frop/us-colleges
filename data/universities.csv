221519,The University of the South,www.sewanee.edu/,,"Since the 1830's Bishop James Otey of Tennessee led an effort to found an Episcopal seminary in the deep south.  Following the Mexican War the Episcopal Church saw tremendous growth in the deep south and a real need for an institution ""to train natives, for natives"" as Otey put it arose.  Up to that point only the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia existed south of the Mason-Dixon Line and other denominations were already establishing schools in the region.  The location was chosen primarily because of the proximity to the major railway hub of Chattanooga, Tennessee and the existing railroad spur up the mountain, the ""Mountain Goat"" which ran from 1858 until April 1985.  Bishop Leonidas Polk commented that due to the access to railroads one could reach any point in the South from Sewanee within thirty-six to forty-eight hours.  On July 4, 1857, delegates from ten Southern dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas—were led up Monteagle Mountain by Bishop Leonidas Polk for the founding of their denominational college for the region. The goal was to create a Southern university free of Northern influences. As one of its co-founders, Bishop James Otey of Tennessee, put it: the new university will ""materially aid the South to resist and repel a fanatical domination which seeks to rule over us."" The majority of the land for the university was donated by the Sewanee Mining Company on the condition that a university ""be put in operation within ten year"".

The FYE Program, part of TCNJ's student-centered approach to teaching, integrates academics, individual development and social understanding. All freshmen live in residence halls, where they have informal access to upper-class mentors, faculty members and student tutors. Expectations also includes Welcome Week, which gives freshmen the opportunity to get to know the campus, settle into residence communities and meet their classmates prior to the start of classes. Students discuss summer readings and are exposed to the four themes they will explore throughout their years at the college: What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be moral, ethical and just? What does it mean to be a member of a community? and How do individuals and communities respond to differences in race, class, gender and ethnicity? Small classes allow close interaction with an exceptional faculty. Many undergraduate students assist faculty members with research and present the results at conferences or coauthor papers. Students are expected to live by the college's mission of community, diversity, service and excellence and to actively participate in campus activities, organizations and events. Hopefully, they will leave the college a better place for having been there. Programs are offered through the Schools of Arts and Sciences, Business, Education, Engineering and Nursing.

The school moved to its present location in Oneonta in 1928, when the Seminary's trustees voted to close it and incorporate there as a four-year college. The land for the campus was donated by the City of Oneonta. Bresee Hall, today the oldest building on campus, was designed by noted architect John Russell Pope and built in 1928.
